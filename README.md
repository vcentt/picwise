This is a POC about generating images with AI tools and collecting a printed version to hang in the wall using https://printhouse.io/, DallE, OpenAi and others.

**Overview**

The product should allow the user to create images with the assistance of one or several of the AI image generating tools and allow them to order a high quality printed version to display in physical form.

**Imaging component**

This component should allow the user to write one or several text and have a way to generate images based on said prompt using. UI for it should be quite similar to the main page of the tool chosen. Below some ideas that may or may not be part of the product.

**Ordering component**

Ones the user likes the result of the imaging component there should be a way for him to create an order based on that image. The order is composed of several items a Payment, a Shipping and so on. This component should allow the user to create the order as well as view the status of his order with an order ID number. There should be a button that will allow the user to see a screen in which the printed version details are chosen, size, format, etc. as well as the payment and delivery information. Below some ideas that may or may not be part of the product.

**Payments component**

Printing things cost money, sadly we canâ€™t give them away. This component will gather payment information, process the credit card payment and generate a receipt as well as provide the customer an order id.

**Shipping component**

A way to track their package. Given an order id display information about the package and a way to contact support if there is a problem.
